EcoForecast: Revolutionizing Green Energy Surplus Prediction in Europe

### The problem

This is a Nuew challenge [link](https://nuwe.io/dev/competitions/schneider-electric-european-2023/ecoforecast-revolutionizing-green-energy-surplus-prediction-in-europe) the goal of which is to predict which country on a list will be the one with the most surplus of green energy.

Since we don't receive the data directly neither for doing the predictions, we retrieved it using ENTSOE API, and split it into the test_data.csv and train_data.csv.
